When you `require('tessel')` within a script which is executed on Tessel 2, this loads a library which interfaces with the Tessel 2 hardware, including pins, ports, and LEDs, just like Tessel 1 ([Tessel 1 hardware documentation](https://github.com/tessel/t1-docs/blob/master/hardware-api.md)). The code for Tessel 2's hardware object can be found [here](https://github.com/tessel/t2-firmware/blob/master/node/tessel-export.js).

## Ports and pins

Tessel has two ports, A and B. They are referred to as `tessel.port.B`. `tessel.port['B']` is also an acceptable reference style.

Tessel's ports can be used as module ports as in Tessel 1 (e.g. `accelerometer.use(tessel.port.B)`), or used as flexible GPIO pins (e.g. `myPin = tessel.port.A.pin[0]`).

### Modules

Tessel 2's module ports can be used with [Tessel modules](//tessel.io/modules) much as in [Tessel 1](http://start.tessel.io/modules).

Here is an example of using the Tessel Climate module on Tessel's port B:

```js
var tessel = require('tessel');
var climatelib = require('climate-si7020').use(tessel.port.B);
```

### Pin mapping

The module ports are not just for modules! They can also be used as flexible, simply addressable General purpose input-output (GPIO) pins. GPIO pins provide access for digital and analog signal lines. Available pins are exposed through the .pin, .digital, .analog, and .pwm arrays.

The pin capabilities for ports A and B are as follows:

| Port | Pin | Digital I/O | SCL | SDA | SCK | MISO | MOSI | TX | RX | Analog In | Analog Out | Interrupt | PWM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 0 | ✓ | ✓ |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| A | 1 | ✓ |   | ✓ |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| A | 2 | ✓ |   |   | ✓ |   |   |   |   |   |   | ✓ |   |

If you're newer to hardware and these functions look like alphabet soup to you, take a look at our [communication protocols documentation](https://tessel.io/docs/communicationProtocols) to get an idea of how these pins should be used.

By default, all of the pins are pulled high if not specifically set.

### Digital pins

A digital pin is either high (on/3.3V) or low (off/0V). Any pin on both ports A and B, other than 3.3V and GND, can be used be used as a digital pin. All pins are pulled high to 3.3V by default.

**pin.write:**

Set the digital value of a pin.

```js
pin.write(number, callback(error, buffer));
```

Option    | Type     | Description                                                                                                     | Required
----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------
number    | Number                                                        | 0 for "low", 1 for "high"                                  | Yes
callback  | Function                                                      | Called when write is complete                              | Yes
error     | Error                                                         | Contains information if an error occured, otherwise `null` | Yes
buffer    | [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v4.x/api/buffer.html) | Value written to the pin                                   | Yes

Example:

```js
var tessel = require('tessel'); // Import tessel
var pin = tessel.port.A.pin[2]; // Select pin 2 on port A
pin.write(1, (error, buffer) => {
  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }

  console.log(buffer.toString()); // Log the value written to the pin
});
```

**pin.read:**

Read the digital value of a pin.

```js
pin.read(callback(error, number));
```

Option    | Type     | Description                                                | Required
----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------
callback  | Function | Called when read is complete                               | Yes
error     | Error    | Contains information if an error occured, otherwise `null` | Yes
number    | Number   | 1 if "high", 0 if "low"                                    | Yes

Example:

```js
var tessel = require('tessel'); // Import tessel
var pin = tessel.port.A.pin[2]; // Select pin 2 on port A
pin.read(function(error, number) {
  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }

  console.log(number); // 1 if "high", 0 if "low"
});
```

### Analog pins

An analog pin is a pin whose value can vary in the range between 0V and 3.3V. The analog pin API represents these this value as a percentage, between 0 and 1, where 1 stands for 3.3V.

**pin.analogWrite:**

Set the analog value of a pin. Enabled on pin 7 of Port B.

```js
pin.analogWrite(number);
```

Option | Type   | Description                      | Required
-------|--------|----------------------------------|---------
number | Number | Minimum value 0, maximum value 1 | Yes

Example:

```js
var tessel = require('tessel'); // Import tessel
var pin = tessel.port.B.pin[7]; // Select pin 7 on port B
pin.analogWrite(0.6);  // Turn pin to 60% of high voltage
```

**pin.analogRead:**

Read the analog value of a pin. Enabled on pins 4 and 7 on Port A,and all pins on Port B. On both ports, all pins are pulled high by default, which means a pin not connected to any sort of sensor or resistor can still return a value over 0.

```js
pin.analogRead(callback(error, number));
```

Option   | Type     | Description                                                | Required
---------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------
callback | Function | Called when read is complete                               | Yes
error    | Error    | Contains information if an error occured, otherwise `null` | Yes
number   | Number   | Minimum value 0, maximum value 1                           | Yes

Example:

```js
var tessel = require('tessel'); // Import tessel
var pin = tessel.port.A.pin[4]; // Select pin 4 on port A
pin.analogRead((error, number) => {
  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }

  console.log(number); // The number is a value between 0 and 1
});
```

### Interrupt Pins

Pins 2, 5, 6, 7 on both Ports are available for interrupts.

Interrupts allow us to register events based on state changes in a pin.

#### Usage

```js
// Invoke the callback whenever the event occurs
pin.on(eventName, callback);

// Invoke the callback the first time the event occurs
pin.once(eventName, callback);
```

#### Available Events

Event Name | Description           | Notes
----------|-----------------------|------
rise      | Pin voltage rises     |
fall      | Pin voltage falls     |
change    | Pin voltage changes   | Passes current value of pin to callback
high\*    | Pin voltage goes high | Only available via pin.once()
low\*     | Pin voltage goes low  | Only available via pin.once()

\* Only one of these events may be registered at a time.

### PWM pins

Tessel has four PWM pins: pins 5 and 6 on each module port.

#### Usage

**tessel.pwmFrequency:**

Set the signal frequency in hertz. 1 hertz equals 1 cycle of signal per second.

```js
tessel.pwmFrequency(number);
```

Option | Type   | Description                         | Required
-------|--------|-------------------------------------|---------
number | Number | Minimum value 1, maximum value 5000 | Yes

Note: the `pwmFrequency` function *must* be called before `pwmDutyCycle`. Re-setting
`pwmFrequency` will disable PWM output until `pwmDutyCycle` is called again.

**pin.pwmDutyCycle:**

Set the percentage amount of time the pin is active each cycle of signal.

```js
pin.pwmDutyCycle(number);
```

Option | Type   | Description                                | Required
-------|--------|--------------------------------------------|---------
number | Number | Minimum value 0, maximum value 1, e.g. 0.6 | Yes

### Terms Used

The following sections use industry standard technical terms that are considered non-inclusive. They are used here in an explicitly technical manner and only to be accurate in describing these wire communication protocols. The terms are used strictly as defined here:

**Master:** A machine or device directly controlling another (source: [Oxford Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/master#master__7))

**Slave:** A device, or part of one, directly controlled by another (source: [Oxford Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/slave#slave__7))

### I2C

An I2C channel uses the SCL and SDA pins (0 and 1 on Tessel 2). If you are unfamiliar with the I2C protocol, please see the [communication protocols tutorial](https://tessel.io/docs/communicationProtocols#i2c).

#### Usage

There are three different commands you can send over I2C: transfer, send, and read.

**i2c.transfer**

Write data to the slave device and then subsequently read data from the slave device. Can be used to read from a specific register (depending on the communication details of the slave device– read the datasheet!).

A common use of this method is to send the address of a register, then receive back the information contained in that register.

```js
var tessel = require('tessel');

// Connect to device
var port = tessel.port.A; // Use the SCL/SDA pins of Port A
var slaveAddress = 0xDE; // Specific to device
var i2c = new port.I2C(slaveAddress); // Initialize I2C communication

// Details of I2C transfer
var bytesToSend = [0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef]; // An array,can be the address of a register or data to write (depends on device)
var numBytesToRead = 4; // Read back this number of bytes

// Send/recieve data over I2C using i2c.transfer
i2c.transfer(new Buffer(bytesToSend), numBytesToRead, function (error, dataReceived) {
  // Print data received (buffer of hex values)
  console.log('Buffer returned by I2C slave device ('+slaveAddress.toString(16)+'):', dataReceived);
});
```

**i2c.send**

Write data over I2C to the slave device without reading data back.

```js
var tessel = require('tessel');

// Connect to device
var port = tessel.port.A; // Use the SCL/SDA pins of Port A
var slaveAddress = 0xDE; // Specific to device
var i2c = new port.I2C(slaveAddress); // Initialize I2C communication

// Details of I2C transfer
var bytesToSend = [0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef]; // An array,can be the address of a register or data to write (depends on device)

// Send data over I2C using i2c.send
i2c.send(new Buffer(bytesToSend), function (error) {
  // Print confirmation
  console.log('Wrote', bytesToSend, 'to slave device', slaveAddress.toString(16), 'over I2C.');
});
```

**i2c.read**

Read data over I2C but do not write to the slave device.

```js
var tessel = require('tessel');

// Connect to device
var port = tessel.port.A; // Use the SCL/SDA pins of Port A
var slaveAddress = 0xDE; // Specific to device
var i2c = new port.I2C(slaveAddress); // Initialize I2C communication

// Details of I2C transfer
var numBytesToRead = 4; // Read back this number of bytes

// Read data over I2C using i2c.transfer
i2c.read(numBytesToRead, function (error, dataReceived) {
  // Print data received (buffer of hex values)
  console.log('Buffer returned by I2C slave device ('+slaveAddress.toString(16)+'):', dataReceived);
});
```

### SPI

A SPI channel uses the SCK, MISO, and MOSI pins (2, 3, and 4 on Tessel 2). If you are unfamiliar with the SPI protocol, please see the [communication protocols tutorial](https://tessel.io/docs/communicationProtocols#spi).

Here is an example using Tessel's SPI protocol:

```js
var port = tessel.port.A;
var spi = new port.SPI({
  clockSpeed: 4*1000*1000, // 4MHz
  cpol: 0, // Polarity - optional
  cpha: 0, // Clock phase - optional
  chipSelect: port.pin[7] // Chip select - optional
});

spi.transfer(new Buffer([0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef]), function (error, dataReceived) {
  console.log('buffer returned by SPI slave:', dataReceived);
});
```

Wikipedia's article on SPI has an excellent [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus#Clock_polarity_and_phase) on polarity (cpol) and clock phase (cpha).

### UART/Serial

A UART (serial) channel uses the TX and RX pins (5 and 6 on Tessel 2). If you are unfamiliar with the UART protocol, please see the [communication protocols tutorial](https://tessel.io/docs/communicationProtocols#uart).

Here is an example using Tessel's UART protocol:

```js
var port = tessel.port.A;
var uart = new port.UART({
  baudrate: 115200
});

uart.write('ahoy hoy\n')
uart.on('data', function (data) {
  console.log('received:', data);
})

// UART objects are streams!
// pipe all incoming data to stdout:
uart.pipe(process.stdout);
```

### Power management

#### Board

**tessel.reboot:**

Power cycle the board. This will clear RAM and restart the program once reboot is complete. This can be done with the [`t2 reboot`](/API/CLI.html#tessel-management) command as well.

```
tessel.reboot();
```

#### Ports

Tessel 2's firmware turns off power to the port if a program does not require the `tessel` module. However, if `tessel` is required in the code, both will be turned on by default. It is possible to control the power to module ports with an explicit call:

```js
var Tessel = require('tessel-export');

var tessel = new Tessel({
 ports: {
   A: false,
   B: false,
 }
});
```

**tessel.open:**

Allow power to one or both Tessel ports.

```js
tessel.open(portName);
```

Option   | Type   | Description       | Required
---------|--------|-------------------|---------
portName | String | Either 'A' or 'B' | No

Leaving out the port name will turn on power to both ports, i.e. `tessel.open()`.

**tessel.close:**

Disallow power to one or both Tessel ports.

```js
tessel.close(portName);
```

Option   | Type   | Description       | Required
---------|--------|-------------------|---------
portName | String | Either 'A' or 'B' | No

Leaving out the port name will turn off power to both ports, i.e. `tessel.close()`.

## LEDs
There are 4 LEDs available on the Tessel 2, you may see them labeled on the board as `ERR`, `WLAN`, `LED0`, and `LED1`. They are available through the `tessel.led` object.

```js
// an array of available LEDs
var leds = tessel.led;

// ERR - Red
var red = leds[0];

// WLAN - Amber
var amber = leds[1];

// LED0 - Green
var green = leds[2];

// LED1 - Blue
var blue = leds[3];
```

Each LED has a few methods for controlling it.


```js
// Green LED
var led = tessel.led[2];

/*
* Property: isOn
* Returns: boolean (true or false) if led is on
*
* Checks the led to see if it is on or not.
*/
if (led.isOn) {
  console.log('The green LED is currently on.');
}

/*
* Method: on
* Returns: the led object (this makes it a chainable function)
*
* Turns the led ON.
*/
led.on();

/*
* Method: off
* Returns: the led object (this makes it a chainable function)
*
* Turns the led OFF.
*/
led.off();

/*
* Method: toggle
* Arguments:
* - callback: function to call once the led's value has been set and is passed an error object if one occured
*
* Toggles the current state of the led and calls the callback function once that is done.
*/
led.toggle(function (error) {
  if (error) {
    console.log('There was an error with toggling the led.', error);
  } else {
    console.log('The green led is now on OR off!');
  }
});
```

## Button

Tessel 2's button is not programmable.

During operation of a script, pressing the button will restart the script.

If you hold down the button while plugging in power, Tessel 2 boots into DFU mode. This is typically used to load firmware built from source.

## USB Ports

USB modules do not need to be accessed through the Tessel object. See [tessel-av](https://github.com/tessel/tessel-av) for an example USB module.
