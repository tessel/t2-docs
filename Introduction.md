## Welcome to the Tessel 2 documentation.

All of the information you need is separated into three sections at left: API, Debugging, and Tutorials.

Looking to learn more about hardware and how to create it? Check out the information in the Tutorials section.

If you are here to debug an issue or get up to speed on the open source project, the Debugging section should help you, particularly the [Technical Overview](/debugging/Technical_Overview.html).
